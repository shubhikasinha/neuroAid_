## Problem Statement

Mental health support is often inaccessible due to:
-  High therapy costs
-  Long waitlists
-  Awkward in-person sessions
-  Limited availability
-  Geographic constraints

Many people need someone to talk to but face barriers in accessing traditional therapy. This creates a gap between those who need mental health support and those who can access it.

Despite growing awareness, many individuals still suffer in silence. Students, in particular, face academic stress, social isolation, and the pressure to appear "okay" online, all while lacking someone to simply talk to.

## Approach & Solution

NeuroAid+ is an AI-powered voice therapy assistant that provides:
- Voice-first conversations that feel natural and comfortable
- Real-time emotional pattern tracking and analysis
- Private, secure, and judgment-free space for self-expression
- Immediate availability without appointments or waitlists
- Session summaries with actionable insights

# NeuroAid Installation & Setup Guide

## Step 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhikasinha/neuroAid_.git
cd agent_ai
````

## Step 2. Install Dependencies

Use either `npm` or `yarn` to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Step 3. Create a `.env` File with Your Vapi API Credentials

This project uses the **Vapi AI SDK** to power real-time voice conversations with your AI assistant.
To make this work, you need to provide **your own Vapi credentials** in a `.env` file.

### Why Do I Need to Create This File?

Vapi provides each developer with a **unique API key and Assistant ID**, which identify:

* **Who** is making the request (you)
* **Which assistant** should respond (your assistant configuration)

We **do not include these keys in the public repository** for security reasons and to avoid misuse of any personal Vapi quota.

### ðŸ”§ How to Set It Up

1. **Go to your Vapi AI dashboard:**
   [https://app.vapi.ai/](https://app.vapi.ai/)
   Create an account (if you havenâ€™t already), and set up your assistant.

2. **Copy your credentials:**

   * Go to **Settings â†’ API Keys** to get your `VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY`.
   * Go to **Assistants â†’ \[Your Assistant]** and copy the `ASSISTANT_ID`.

3. **Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.**
   Paste your credentials like this:

   ```env
   VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
   VITE_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_here
   ```

## Step 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Step 5. Open in Browser

Navigate to:
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
